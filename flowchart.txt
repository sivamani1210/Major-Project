1. importing the packages
2. exploring the dataset - PlantVilage Data
3. Image Processing 
	- Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning
	- Feature Extraction using OpenCV for SVM & SVR
4. Data Extraction 
5. Splitting the data into Train and Test
6. Model building
    - MobileNet
    - PACNet based INceptionResNetV2
    - NMF-TDNet using Convo Layers
    - SVM
    - SVR
7.Training the Model with Train and Test and building the model 
8.Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
9.User gives input 
10.the given input is preprocessed for prediction
11.trained model is used for prediction for about image 
12.final outcome is displayed through frontend

Extension - MobileNet model along with the SVR is used as extension where 
MobileNet model gives better accuarcy with less epochs comparing all other model and used to predicting the
user inputs for analysis
